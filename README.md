## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
Click the "Open in Codespaces" button next to any project to launch a complete development environment in your browser. No installation required!

**Note:** Codespaces may take 1-2 minutes to set up initially as it installs g++, make, and valgrind.

### Option 2: Local Development
Clone this repository and navigate to any project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdxLearn/cos110-projects.git
cd cos110-projects/week4/project1_complex_numbers
make
./program_name
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Compiler:** g++ with C++98 standard support
- **Build tool:** GNU Make
- **Memory checker (optional):** Valgrind

## 🛠️ Building Projects

Each project includes a `Makefile` with standard targets:

```bash
make          # Compile the project
make run      # Compile and run
make clean    # Remove compiled files
make rebuild  # Clean and recompile
```
